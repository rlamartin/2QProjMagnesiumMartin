						<h1>Transmission of Covid-19</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>Covid-19 primarily spreads from person to person. 
						This can occur when an infected person coughs and he spreads aerosol droplets which can reach 6 feet or more. 
						These droplets can be inhaled by an uninfected person which will spread the virus onto him. 
						One can also be infected through surface transmission. 
						This occurs when you touch a surface contaminated by the virus and then proceed to touch any orifice of your body (eyes, nose, mouth). 
						Covid-19 can last for several hours or days, depending on the surface.
						Its particles can last up to 4 hours on copper and 3 days on stainless steel. </p>

						<h1>Prevention Methods</h1>
						<hr>
						<h4>Wearing Masks</h4>
						<p>This is a requirement when going outside as it will help keep you and other people from spreading the virus. 
						For example, when two people are wearing masks and one of them is infected with the coronavirus. 
						The infected person coughs but the mask prevents the spread of the virus since it keeps the infected particles within his mask.
						The other personâ€™s mask also protects him since it prevents any particles from contaminating him.
						</p>
						<hr>
						<h4>Washing hands through the use of soap</h4>
						<p>This will kill the virus. 
						It is recommended that one washes his hands for at least 20 seconds before touching his face. 
						This will reduce the chances of the virus being transferred to you. 
						Hand sanitizer that has high amounts of alcohol can be a substitute if soap is not readily available.
						</p>
						<hr>
						<h4>Applying social distancing</h4>
						<p>This is done through the 6 feet rule. 
						This will allow you and other people to prevent the spread of the virus. 
						Again, do not forget that some people may still be able so spread the virus even without symptoms. 
						Even when inside your home, this rule should still be observed.
