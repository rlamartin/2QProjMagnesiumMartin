						<h1>Unemployment</h1>
						<hr>
						<p>Before the pandemic affected the Philippines, its unemployment rate was at around 5%. 
						However, this all changed when Covid-19 attacked.
						Since many people were forced to be inside their homes during lockdown, a lot of people lost their jobs. 
						This led to 4.5 million Filipinos losing their jobs in 2020 and the unemployment rate increasing up to 17.6 per cent in April 2020. 
						Fortunately, this number decreased to 8.7 per cent or 3.8 million jobless in October of 2020. 
						Comparing this to October of 2019, it was only 4.6 per cent or 2 million jobless.</p>
