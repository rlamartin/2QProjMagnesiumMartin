						<h1>Vaccines (Definition and Examples)</h1>
						<hr>
						<p>Vaccines are substances that are used in order to protect people from diseases. 
						They do their jobs by entering a person’s body through the nose, mouth, and an injection. 
						The vaccines contain weakened versions of the original viruses. 
						They are not strong enough to be a threat, but your body still solves this problem through the creation of antibodies. 
						This means that when you are infected with the actual virus, your body is prepared to fight back against it.</p>
						
						<p>According to the CDC (2021), some side effects of this vaccine are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Pain</li>
							<li>Redness</li>
							<li>Tiredness</li>
							<li>Headache</li>
							<li>Chills</li>
							<li>Fever</li>
							<li>Nausea</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Despite the numerous side effects that may occur, these are good signs which mean that your body is beginning to build a resistance against the virus. 
						They typically go away after a few days. Some of the vaccines that are being currently used are: </p>

									<h1>mRNA-1273 (Moderna) Vaccine</h1>
									<p>This vaccine was manufactured by ModernaTX Inc. It is given to people aged 18 and above. It has 2 shots which are 28 days apart, that are injected into the muscle of the upper arm. According to clinical trials, the Moderna vaccine was 93.1% effective in preventing Covid infections amongst those who received two doses and were not previously infected  (CDC, 2021). The side effects of this vaccine (like fever and chills) were more prevalent after the second dose. There were also more severe side effects like myocarditis and pericarditis but these were rare and the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the possible risks.</p>

									<h1>Sinovac’s Coronovac</h1>
									<p>This vaccine was manufactured by Sino-vac. It is given to people aged 18 and above. It has 2 shots which are 2-4 weeks apart. According to the WHO (2021),  “A large phase 3 trial in Brazil showed that two doses, administered at an interval of 14 days, had an efficacy of 51% against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 100% against severe COVID-19, and 100% against hospitalization starting 14 days after receiving the second dose.” </p>

									<h1>Pfizer-BioNTech (Pfizer) Vaccine</h1>
									<p>This vaccine was manufactured by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech. It is currently the only vaccine within the Philippines that is authorized to be injected into individuals aged 5-17. It is injected into the muscle of the upper arm. People who take this vaccine have two shots which are 21 days apart. Clinical trials have unearthed that the Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective in preventing the virus for ages 16 and older, provided that they had a double dose. It was also discovered that the Pfizer vaccine had a 90% efficacy rate in preventing Covid-19 within children aged 5-15. Their resistance against the virus was also as strong as people aged 16-25 years old (CDC,2021).</p>
